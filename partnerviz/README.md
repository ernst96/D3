Partner Performance Visualization
===========

This is a prototype developed in D3 for a major entertainment company to visualize supply chain performance for distribution partners. I used Bootstrap and jQuery for the needed ui widgets and convenient plumbing.

As you can see, poorly performing partners float to the top and are color coded in a green-to-red color scale to allow users to quickly identify potential issues. 

Mousing over a partner displays additional detail.

For the demo I included static data sets that can be loaded with the buttons on the top left labeled 1,2,3...

A user can quickly find a particular partner by entering an ID in the search. Moving the mouse over the visualization will reset the search and restore the display of all partners.
