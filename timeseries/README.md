Real Time and Historical System Performance Visualizing
===========

Sony Music's digital supply chain manages the delivery of media assets and metadata to the company's distribution partners.
The team managing this process needed a real time and historic view into the performance of these systems with the primary
objective of mitigating system downtime and identifying current and developing delivery activity issues.

Distribution partner feeds are displayed with total package counts and packaging status visualized with time series bar charts.
The past 60 minutes are shown to the right with rolled up hourly and 2 hour history to the left.

To test performance I added a slider control that allows you to increase the update interval.
