D3 Sunburst
===========

This is one of my first experiments with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/ "D3js.org")

Inspired by the [windrose](http://windhistory.com/station.html?KSFO) featured on D3js.org, this is a sunburst that shows relative volume by the length of each burst. Color indicates a second dimension and each burst has a label that is positioned on the outside.
